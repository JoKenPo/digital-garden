### Complaint Email

Greetings,

My name is Eduardo Almeida and I **AM** sending this email because I had a bad experience with your agency on our last trip.

Starting with the delayed flight departing from São Paulo. We wait**ed** around 2 hours in the airport and nobody knew why.
After, we got **to** know that the itinerary was different from what we had confirmed.

Arriving there, we had to pay additional fees for the delay that was unexpected.

We got a cancellation too, on the massage ~~from~~  **on** the last day that we wanted so much.

So, we want a minimum of responsiveness from your agency and a way to refund what we lost in this trip. 

Regards,
Eduardo Almeida
